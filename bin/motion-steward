def create_app
  puts <<~INSTRUCTIONS
  I need the name of your app. Here are some tips:

  - If you haven't done so, you should really run the research command before committing to a name for your app.
  - Using spaces is fine.
  - Using a hypen after the main app name (eg: "Metal Gear - Tactical Espionage") is fine.
  - Make the app name memorable because this is what people will use to find your app in the App Store.
  - Here are examples of BAD app names:
    - "Threes!" Why? Because it has an exclamation point (punctuation) in the main app name. Apps that use punctuation are hard to find.
    - "T.L.D.R. Reddit" Why? Because it has periods (punctuation) in the main app name. Apps that use punctuation are hard to find.
    - "Heroes Fighting" Why? Heroes is a saturated app keyword (there are many others). It'll make your app incredibly difficult to find.
